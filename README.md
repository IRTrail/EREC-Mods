## [Based on the EREC](https://github.com/kevinakasam/ERCF_Filament_Cutter)
## With other stuff from [here](https://www.printables.com/model/886128-ercf-erec-encoder-mounted-filament-cutter/files)

This mod installs the smaller, but equivalent power, [ProModeler DS210CLHV](https://www.promodeler.com/DS210CLHV) mini servo in place of the MR966 standard sized servo.  
The build is somewhat simplified by making the servo mount and encoder mount a single piece.  
The encoder housing is updated to use the V623VV bearing as is the current practice in the ERCF world.  
The cutter gear is modified to use less plastic and print faster.  
The drive gear is modified to fit a regular old round Futaba servo wheel (21mm diameter...go to your local RC hobby shop, they probably have them in bulk or you can buy them [here](https://www.promodeler.com/PDRS107)).  
The selector cart is modified for wire routing, as is the idler block.
## Assembly
Assembly is straight forward. If there's a 4.7mm hole, that means you should put a heat set in it.
1. First, use some 2mm SHCS about 6mm long to attach the servo wheel to the drive gear.
2. Slip the drive gear assembly into the servo mount and then insert the servo in the housing. Push the drive gear assembly on the splines.
3. The servo is held in by 3mm screws threaded directly into the plastic. There is no reason for heat set inserts as the housing takes the force of the servo and the screws just hold it in place. Put 3mm button head or socket head screws in to hold the servo in place. You don't need to hork down on them so much that you mess up the servo mounting tabs. Yes, the screws go in from the bottom of the servo.
4. Assemble the encoder housing using the parts you already have. The only difference is putting a heat set in from the back at the cutting arm pivot.
5. Assemble the cutting arm with a #11 Xacto Blade and a couple 2mm SHCS screws. Then put a 683ZZ bearing ([affiliate link](https://amzn.to/456EyPS)) in each side of the pivot. Push an ECAS fitting in the filament path. Take the soft rubber part off first, but leave the hard plastic part on.
6. Use a 3x25mm cap screw to attach the cutting arm to the encoder housing. Put a washer between the bearing and encoder housing for a little space. It is important to make sure the washer is smaller than the outer race of the bearing to prevent drag.
7. Remove the selector cart and idler block from your ERCF. Replace with the new parts. Don't hose up the linear bearings while removing them from the old selector cart.
8. Install the encoder housing on the selector cart and ensure everything slides easily on the linear axis.
9. Install the servo mount, making sure to place the cutting arm correctly. (You may have to remove and reposition during macro tuning.)
10. Use the included zip tie grooves to route the servo wire for both the EREC and the selector.
11. Install the macro from the main EREC (or just enable it in Happy Hare) and tune appropriately.
12. Brag all over discord about how cool the servo looks.
